# LLM-LangChain

This repository contains my explorations and practice with Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI and Gemini, using the LangChain framework. The main focus is to integrate and experiment with LLMs, showcasing various use cases, tools, and capabilities.

## Contents

- **LangChain.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the usage of LLMs via the LangChain framework, including examples with OpenAI and Gemini.

## Features

- **LLM Integration**: Using LangChain to integrate with various LLMs, such as OpenAI and Gemini.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting prompts for different use cases.
- **Chain Logic**: Creating chains that process and analyze text with LangChain tools.
- **Model Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of LLM responses for different tasks.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you will need the following dependencies:

- `langchain`
- `openai`
- `gemini` (if available via API)
- `jupyterlab` or `notebook`

Install the dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install langchain openai jupyterlab
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sameertak/LLM-LangChain.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the directory:

   ```bash
   cd LLM-LangChain
   ```

3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Langchain.ipynb
   ```

4. Run the cells to see how different LLMs behave with various tasks and prompts using LangChain.
